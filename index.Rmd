# Prerequisites {-}

If you want to follow along with the code in the book, you will need access to some of the data sets we use. 
You can download a zip archive of all the data [here](https://github.com/pp4rs/pp4rs-rstats/raw/master/.assets/data.zip).
Extract the contents of the zip archive and place them in a subdirectory `data`.
Then the code should work as is.
